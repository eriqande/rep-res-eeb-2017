# Week One Meeting {#week1}

Tina is going to be helping everyone get their systems all set up. After that there
will be some fun things to do to see what sorts of things are possible.

## Software Installation

1. **RStudio:** We want the latest "development" version of RStudio becuase it has features that we may want
to use during this course.  Get it from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) 
and install the appropriate one for your OS.

1. **R:**  Let's make sure that we are all using the latest version of R.  On March 7, 2017, version 3.3.3 was released.
Go to [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) and find the download link for your computer system.
Download it and install it.

1. **bookdown:** This package is what I used to create this course notes.  Getting it automatically installs a lot of 
other packages that are useful for authoring reproducible research.  We want the latest development version, which 
can be obtained from GitHub by issuing the following commans at the R prompt (i.e. in the console window of RStudio:)
    ```{r get-bd, eval=FALSE}
    install.packages("devtools")  
    devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
    ```

1. Install **other packages** that we are going to be needing in the first few weeks.  If you don't know how to 
install packages, ask Tina and she can show you.  Install: `tidyverse`, and `stringr`.


1. Make sure that **git** is up and running on your system. 
    - If you are using a Mac with a reasonably new OS,
you should be able to just open the Terminal application (`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`) and type "git"
at the command line.  If you have `git` it will say something that starts like:
        ```{sh, eval=FALSE}
    usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
   etc. etc. etc.
        ```
        If you do not have `git` then it should pop up a little thing asking if you would like to install
a reduced set of developer tools.  You do.  Click OK.
    - If you are using a PC, I can't be as much help, but you can find links with instructions on how to download
    `git` for a PC [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN).
    - If you are using Linux then we will assume you know how to get `git` or that you already have it.
    

## Get an account on GitHub

If you don't already have an account on GitHub, go to [github.com](github.com) and click the "sign up" link near upper right 
of the page.  It is pretty self-explanatory.  Go ahead and get a **free** account.  There is nothing to pay for here!

### Private repositories

_If you are a graduate student_ and you do not feel comfortable posting your data on a public site like
GitHub, then you should request some private repositories from GitHub.  GitHub has a great deal for academic
users like students: free private repositories.  Please go to [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
to sign up for your free student pack.  


## Create an RStudio Project with Your Own Data

Your mission for the following week---i.e., please have this done (or as done as you can get it) by Friday, April 14, 2017---is
to prepare an RStudio project with your own data set, and provide some background about the data and
the ways that you would like to analyze it.
