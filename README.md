# rep-res-eeb-2017

These are note for a course "Case Studies in Reproducible Research" we are
doing at UCSC in spring of 2017.  They are 
written up using R Markdown and compiled to a readable format with the
**bookdown** package.  (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 
The compiled products are built using RStudio into the `docs`
directory, from whence they are served up as GitHub Pages.  Pretty cool!

You can find the bookdown-ed version of these notes at example at
