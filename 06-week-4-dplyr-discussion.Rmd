# Week Four Meeting {#week4}

This was a bit of a free-form discussion on a variety of topics.

## Knit your README.Rmd files

First thing we talked about was the fact that GitHub will render a `README.md` file
to an html web page that is nice and easy to read.  It will sort of render a README.Rmd
file, but it won't do everything to it.  Namely:

1. The YAML header block comes out as a table.
2. It will __not__ evaluate all the R code and deliver the results.

Rather, it is necessary to locally _knit_ the `README.Rmd` file to create a `README.md`, then 
this `README.md` file must be committed to the repository and pushed.  This needs to happen each
time you have updated the `README.Rmd` file.  

Note that your `README.Rmd` file should start with the following:
```{r comment=''}
cat(readLines("inputs/readme-header.txt"), sep = '\n')
```


## Changing to factors

Mikki had a question:  she wanted to have a column that contained 1's and 2's as factors.  her
data set had several entries that were "1,2".  She wanted to convert those to 2's and then make them
all factors.  We discussed how this could be done with dplyr.  The important message was that dplyr does not
change the original input variable, but in the output, you can "mutate over the top of an existing variable".  
(i.e. in the output the column will have been changed, but not in the original input data frame.)

## The `group_by()` function

We spent a bit of time going over how to think about what the `group_by()` function does.  Eric likes to
think of it as breaking your original tibble up into a lot of different tibbles, according to the grouping
variables, after which, each little tibble gets sent to the following verb (`summarise()`, `mutate()`, `filter()`, etc.)

We talked about that fact that while it is quite natural to think about using the `group_by()` function 
in conjunction with `summarise()`, it is also very powerful to be able to use it in conjuntion with `mutate()`.

When you do a summarise, only the grouping variables and the newly-created summary variables get returned in
the output tibble, and the rows are arranged by the grouping variables.  When you do a `group_by()` and then `mutate()`
all of the columns get returned and there is no automatic arranging that goes on.
