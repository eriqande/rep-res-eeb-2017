THey can be downloaded as shape files here 
[https://mpsl.mlml.calstate.edu/GIS-shapefile-layers](https://mpsl.mlml.calstate.edu/GIS-shapefile-layers).




```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
library(rgdal)
library(ggspatial)  # use GitHub version


ws_dir <- normalizePath("~/Documents/MapStuff/GISlayers_calw221_shp")

calw <- readOGR(dsn = ws_dir, 
        layer = "calw221")

ggplot() +
  geom_spatial(calw, colour = "white")

```
